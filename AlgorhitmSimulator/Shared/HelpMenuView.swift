                    1. A* (A star)
                    2. Dijkstra
                    3. custom Dijkstra implementation (multithread)
                
                Also there is an editor which allows user to create their own testing grounds using provided object's shapes and modifiable parameters of those objects. Preview of aplications look is present below. in further parts of this help view i will try to make it easier to use the application for new users using images to make it easier to understad.
